## Area of intervention

Promoting reconciliation and easing conflict through pet's behavior and interaction with people in the domestic space.

## Research Question

1. How does your pet help calm your emotions?
2. What behavior of your pet most effectively lightens the mood during an argument?

## Research

My research focuses on how pets can shift attention away from conflict and promote reconciliation between people. To explore this, I first observed pet behaviors, sounds, and their interactions with the surrounding environment. Additionally, based on these observations, I conducted surveys to gain insights into how pets can help in conflict resolution.

### Observations

## First ideas & prototypes

### Messybot

When conflicts arise at home, this robot draws attention with vibrant movements and lights, releasing dust into the air. Alternatively, while people are arguing, the robot creates minor messes around the house to divert their attention and lighten the atmosphere.

### Rolly

By utilizing a cat's righting reflex, the robot rolls toward people in the household during conflict situations, showing amusing movements based on this reflex. This helps to divert attention and guide the situation toward conflict resolution.

### Mochi

Inspired by Schr√∂dinger's cat, the robot usually operates in hidden mode, concealing its presence. During conflict, it transforms into bright and warm colors, approaching people to signal a shift from a state of ‚Äúnon-existence‚Äù to ‚Äúexistence.‚Äù Through light, vibration, and soft touch, it provides emotional comfort and helps ease tension.

## Next Steps

I will conduct more research on how people resolve conflicts step-by-step, as my current prototypes mainly focus on distracting people from the conflict. I will also explore ways to make the robots more interactive and responsive to their environment
