## Project title

<!-- Think a simple, straightforward title, can also be poetic or playful but keep it short. -->

**Felimo - Your Emotional Companion**

Felis(cat) + Felix(happy) + motus(emotion)

## Research Question / area of research

<!-- One or two sentences, describing questions that your project evokes. For example: "What new relationships can we have with traditional altars?" -->

1. How does your pet help calm your emotions?
2. What behavior of your pet most effectively lightens the mood during an argument?

## Pitch

<!-- One sentence to describe what is your concept. (~100 chars max) For example: "My project is a sound tapestry that records and transform human conversations".

- Key visual (from your 3D renderings or your paper prototypes)
- Optional second visual -->

My project is a playful and interactive distractor that defuse tension and support emotional well-being.

## Prototyping research

<!-- Describe in a short paragraph (~500 chars) the research that you have conducted around your prototypes. What were your intentions? What are the several forms you looked into? What were the different interactions you tried? Illustrate each method with corresponding photo, sketches, audio, movies, 3D visuals etc. You can put a lot of elements here, but please curate the most illustrative materials. -->

My initial concept was inspired by cats as mediators in conflicts by calming and interrupting fights. However, conflict is complex, and simple distraction can sometimes intensify it. I looked into conflict resolutions as well as conflict escalation models.

Later, I realized that beyond conflicts, cats offer emotional comfort in amusing ways. Inspired by how my cat interacts with me, I envisioned a robot that recognizes and responds to emotions, much like a cat does. In the end, inspired by **cats are liquid** article, I created a wavy paper prototypes.

## Key prototype 1

<!-- Short paragraph (~250 chars) describing the prototype and your concept, what it does, how does it act, why does it exist etc.

- One photo of the paper prototype (can be gif animation, or static)
- One 3D image
- (Optional) Audio
- (Optional) Video -->

This prototype is an interactive and playful robot inspired by cats defusing tension and providing comfort. It acts as a mediator, responding to emotional cues with soft, fluid motions to distract, amuse, and support emotional well-being during tense moments.

| **Input**             | **Output**                                                                                                                                              | **Image**                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Sound Volume**      | The first and last rings move toward the middle ring and then return to their original positions. The larger the volume, the faster the movement speed. | ![alt text](./images/IMG_5832_SLOWER.gif) |
| **Sound Volume > 50** | If the sound volume is above a certain level, the robot shakes its body.                                                                                | ![alt text](./images/shaking.gif)         |
| **Sound Pitch**       | The higher the sound pitch, the color of the robot changes from yellow to red.                                                                          |                                           |

| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |

| **Input**        | **Output**                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Image**                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Sound Volume** | The lower the sound volume, the more the robot bends left and right. When the volume increases, the movement stops.                                                                             | ![alt text](./images/BENDING.gif)         |
| **Sound Pitch**  | When the sound volume is above a certain level(50), bending stops, and the robot repeats shrinking and expanding. Higher sound pitch increases the speed of shrinking and stretching movements. | ![alt text](./images/IMG_5838_SLOWER.gif) |

- Input:
  - sound volume
  - sound pitch (high or low)
- Output:
  - left and right bending
  - speed of bending
  - shrinking and stretching movements
  - speed of shrinking and stretching movements

## Next Steps

In the next step, I plan to connect a sound sensor and a servo motor to implement the robot's interaction. Additionally, I will study the slider-crank mechanism to enable the robot's movement and experiment with various paper materials for its structure.
