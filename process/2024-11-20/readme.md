## Concept (~ing)

This soft robot isn't just about fighting, they can create a variety of effects while getting people's attention.
For example, digital detox or sensory healing.
Fire-watching offers a rich sensory experience through its warmth, sound, and light. Water-watching stimulates the senses with the sounds of water, shimmering reflections, and its steady flow, providing a healing effect. Scientific studies have shown that simply listening to the sound of water can lower heart rates and alleviate stress.

## Final Shape

- Basically, at first the robot is very flat.
- When it detects small sounds, it will undulate like a wave.
- When it detects loud sounds, it gradually increases in volume, creating a spherical 3D shape just like a pufferfish inflates itself like a balloon when it senses danger, cats as well.
- When a person approaches the robot, it tilts left and right alternately. Just like a cat tilts its head when curious about something.
