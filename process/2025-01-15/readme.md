- It was good to see your process and how you developed the robot.
- Depending on how to code the robot (software), the robot could have more dynabic movements and noises. It's very important!
- Presentation
  - I need to add more field observations that I conducted because there are good insights from them.
  - I also have to add robot's different behaviors(states) to show the robot's personality and organic movements in detail.
  - I need to add what I got from the user testings and how I improved the robot based on the feedbacks.
