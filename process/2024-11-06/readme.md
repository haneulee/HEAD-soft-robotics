#### 4. Summary Paragraph

**Moodiator** is a domestic soft robot inspired by the calming influence of cats, designed to help defuse tense conversations and foster reconciliation between people. Just as cats often lighten the mood with playful distractions, affectionate gestures, or a gentle nuzzle, this soft robot uses similar behaviors to de-escalate emotions. The robot provides subtle, non-verbal cues that help shift attention away from conflict, ease heightened emotions, and ultimately guide people toward a calmer, more balanced state of mind. By offering a comforting presence and engaging interactions, Moodiator aims to create a more harmonious atmosphere in the home, supporting healthier relationships and emotional well-being.

<!-- it‚Äôs essential to start from the interaction: What will the defining interaction and gesture be? How will your robot communicate with its surroundings? Do not worry too much about technical possibilities at the moment.
