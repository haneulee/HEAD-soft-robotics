Schr√∂dinger's cat: a cat, a flask of poison, and a radioactive source connected to a Geiger counter are placed in a sealed box. As illustrated, the quantum description uses a superposition of an alive cat and one that has died.

## Paper Prototypes

### **Robot Using the Cat's Righting Reflex**

| ![](./images/right-reflex.png) | ![](./images/right-reflex2.png) |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |

By utilizing a cat's righting reflex, the robot rolls toward people in the household during conflict situations, showing amusing movements based on this reflex. This helps to divert attention and make them to reconcile.

### **Schr√∂dinger's Cat-Inspired Robot**

| ![](./images/schrod.png) | ![](./images/schrod2.png) |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- |

Inspired by Schr√∂dinger's cat, the robot usually operates in hidden mode, concealing its presence. During conflict, it transforms into bright and warm colors, approaching people to signal a shift from a state of ‚Äúnon-existence‚Äù to ‚Äúexistence.‚Äù Through light, vibration, and soft touch, it provides emotional comfort and helps ease tension.

### **Robot Using Cat Tail Movements**

| ![](./images/tail.png) | ![](./images/tail.gif) |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |

Based on the movements of a cat's tail, this robot sways its tail and approaches people during conflict situations, giving a soft vibration to help ease the tension. Just as a cat puffs up its tail when frightened, the robot sways its tail in times of conflict to convey a sense of calm and reassurance.

### **Messy Robot**

| ![](./images/messy.png) | ![](./images/messy.gif) |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |

When conflicts arise at home, this robot draws attention with vibrant movements and lights, releasing dust into the air. Alternatively, while people are arguing, the robot creates minor messes around the house to divert their attention and lighten the atmosphere.

<!-- it‚Äôs essential to start from the interaction: What will the defining interaction and gesture be? How will your robot communicate with its surroundings? Do not worry too much about technical possibilities at the moment.

For the presentation on November 6th, we would like you to prepare the following items:

1. A brief summary of your observations and field research (you can use your GitHub for this).
A title
A single phrase summarizing your idea in a few words
A few keywords (can be around the interaction, your sensor, your actuator, your robot‚Äôs intention, your context‚Ä¶)
A short paragraph summarizing your idea so far
1. A series of paper prototypes, including examples of what did not work. At least 4 !
2. At least three storyboards that illustrate how your prototypes can be used. These can include different storyboards for various prototypes or different variations of a single idea. -->
