USM Haller's MINI and MIDI are two variants of a modular steel construction system designed by Swiss architect Fritz Haller. This system was developed to efficiently construct buildings of various sizes and purposes.

#### MINI

Mainly used in one- to two-story buildings, it has been used for a variety of purposes, including residential houses, offices, school pavilions, laboratories, and exhibition halls. The system has a pole spacing of up to 8.4 meters and can be freely expanded horizontally. Additionally, the exterior wall panels are removable so you can easily change them as needed.

#### MIDI

Suitable for industrial buildings with two or more floors, and has been used in the construction of schools, offices, laboratories, hospitals, etc. This system integrates the building facility's piping system as part of the overall structure, enabling efficient space utilization and facility placement.

These modular systems responded to a variety of construction needs by providing short construction periods, easy expansion and modification, and the flexibility to dismantle and reassemble.

"A new chewing gum designed as an educational tool to inspire creativity and teach people how to think innovatively."

This gum is very soft and stretchy. And when it combines with oxygen outside, it hardens in a short time. People can use this gum to create creative sculptures and it can be used for children's creative education.
